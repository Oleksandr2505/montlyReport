# montlyReport
montly report out of all employees.
//I was able to execute this program by displaying the data in the console
//sorting employee's hours to create a monthly report and write the correct data into the file
//probably this is not the most effective solution out of all possible solutions, but it fully performs its purpose
// here I combined outputting data to the console and also write it into the file file1.txt
//In the main function of the monthly report, I computed the hours with the same names of employees and displayed the result
//I computed all possible cases up to 25 requests (25 working days) per employee
//I added a log class for denoting errors in a file
